# Decomposition Module

Decomposition represents heterotrophic respiration of litter and soil organic matter. The process of modelling decomposition is akin to turnover in plant material, where a proportion of biomass in litter and soil organic matter decays through time. The rates of this will vary with location based on the prevailing environmental conditions.
