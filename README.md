## About moja global
Moja global is an international collaboration under the Linux Foundation that provides software tools to better manage the land sector (i.e. forest and agriculture.) The flagship software is called Full Lands Integration Tool (FLINT) and it is used to estimate emissions and removals of greenhouse gases from the land sector. FLINT uses a range of input data and combines it with model greenhouse gas fluxes between a range of pools for every time step. At every time step, all pool values and the fluxes between all pools are stored in an output database. Reports are generated by a reporting tool that queries the database and arranges the results in the required format.  

In 2020 moja global is completed 2 GSoD projects! Thanks to [Sneha](https://github.com/Tlazypanda) and [Anthony](https://github.com/Tonnix) for all their hard work.
